.SH NAME
extraw - Separation of data packets from control packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
extraw
.I inkey
.I datkey
.I datsize
.I ctlkey
.I ctlsize
[
.I logfile
]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extraw loads "packet type-specified" win format data cyclically written in a shared memory segment identified by a key
.I \ inkey,
and separates packets into data packets (type codes "A1" to "A4") and control packets (other than type codes "A1" to "A4") according to the packet types to remove their packet type codes and write them out separately to the two shared memory segments identified by another key
.I \ datkey
and yet another key
.I \ ctlkey.
If neither a shared memory segment with the key
.I \ datkey
nor
.I \ ctlkey
exists, shared memory segments of sizes
.I \ datsize
\ (KB) 
and
.I \ ctlsize
\ (KB)
will be created respectively. If they already exist but have a size smaller than their respective specified sizes, an error will occur.
The shared memory key is a 32-bit integer value.
.LP
When log file name
.I \ logfile
is specified, operation log is set here. When it is not specified, log information is sent to the standard output. The log file is opened/closed in each write.
.LP
Data in the format prescribed for the input-side shared memory
.I inkey
are data of packets with type codes greater than "A1." These data are received/written in by such processes as recvs(1W) or recvt(1W) with \-a option. For more details of the data format, refer to the applicable sections.
.LP
The format prescribed for the output-side shared memories
.I datkey
and
.I ctlkey
is the normal timestamped format without a type code.
For more details of these data formats, refer to recvt(1W).
.LP
When extraw is initiated without argument, brief usage is displayed.
