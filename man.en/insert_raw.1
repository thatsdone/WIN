.SH NAME
insert_raw - Insertion of timed-out data into one minute files
.SH SYNOPSIS
insert_raw
.I prmfile
[
.I start
.I end
]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Insert_raw reads data files that timed out to order(1W) generated by wdiskts(1W) and inserts them into proper lines in one minute files (continuous files) written by wdisk(1W).
.I prmfile
has a part which goes as follows:
.nf
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªFROM HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª
# This file is insert_raw's parameter file
/dat/raw                # raw data dir
/dat/raw_timeouts       # time-out data dir
/dat/tmp                # temporary dir
3                       # wait min. from raw LATEST
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªTO HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª            ^^^
.fi.
The line starting with # is a comment. The number in the fourth line is a value that means that timed-out data will be immediately inserted into up to the file three minutes older than raw LATEST. If this number is not specified, it defaults to DEFAULT_WAIT_MIN. This parameter has been provided because it may be inconvenient if raw should be overwritten while events is cutting out a file. If a future packet is contained, insert_raw will sleep until the time of that packet.
.I start
and
.I end
specify the range of timeout data in 'YYMMDDhh.mm' format.
They do not specify the range of any raw data.
.LP
When insert_raw is initiated without any argument, brief usage is displayed.
