.SH NAME
insert_raw2 - Insertion of timed-out data into one minute files
.SH SYNOPSIS
insert_raw2
.I prmfile
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Insert_raw2 is the high-speed (low-load) version of insert_raw(1W) and is a shell script.
Insert_raw2 reads data files that timed out to order(1W) generated by wdiskts(1W) and inserts them into proper lines in one minute files (continuous files) written by wdisk(1W).
.I prmfile
has a part which goes as follows:
.nf
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªFROM HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª
# This file is insert_raw's parameter file
/dat/raw                # raw data dir
/dat/raw_timeouts       # time-out data dir
/dat/tmp                # temporary dir
3                       # wait min. from raw LATEST
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªTO HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª            ^^^
.fi.
The line starting with # is a comment. The number in the fourth line is a value that means that timeout data will be immediately inserted into up to the file three minutes older than raw LATEST.
.LP
Insert_raw2 uses wdisk(1W) and wadd2(1W) internally.
Insert_raw2 uses the 'date -j' command internally, but this seems to work only with FreeBSD4.X and later.
.LP
When insert_raw2 is initiated without any argument, brief usage is displayed.
