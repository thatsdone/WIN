.SH NAME
insert_trg - Insertion of timed-out data into event files
.SH SYNOPSIS
insert_trg
.I prmfile
[
.I start
.I end
]
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Insert_trg reads data files that timed out to order(1W) generated by wdiskts(1W) and inserts them into event files written by events(1W).
.I prmfile
has a part which goes as follows:
.nf
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªFROM HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª
# This file is insert_trg's parameter file
/dat/trg                # trg data dir
/dat/raw_timeouts       # time-out data dir
/dat/tmp                # temporary dir
3                       # wait min. from timeout LATEST
„ª„ª„ª„ª„ªTO HERE„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª„ª            ^^^^^^^
.fi
The line starting with # is a comment. The number in the fourth line is a value that means that an attempt will be immediately made to insert timeout data into up to the file three minutes older than timeout LATEST.
It behaves differently from insert_raw. If this number is not specified, it defaults to DEFAULT_WAIT_MIN. Even if a number smaller than DEFAULT_WAIT_MIN is specified, it defaults to DEFAULT_WAIT_MIN.
.I start
and
.I end
specify the range of timeout data in 'YYMMDDhh.mm' format.
They do not specify the range of any raw data.
.LP
When insert_trg is initiated without any argument, brief usage is displayed.
