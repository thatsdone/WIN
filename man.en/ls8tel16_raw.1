.SH DESCRIPTION
ls8tel16_raw loads Hakusan win format data transmitted from data logger LS-8000SH (firmware: LS8TEL16) manufactured by Hakusan Corporation and cyclically written in a shared memory segment identified by a key
.I \ inkey
and converts them into the normal win format to write them to another shared memory segment identified by another key
.I \ outkey.
However, if a channel file
.I \ chfile
is given, only the data of the channels listed in the file will be converted and written out while any other channels are ignored.
If the channel file name is prefixed with '\+,' only the channels listed in the file will be converted and written out while any other channels are just copied to the output.
If the channel file name is prefixed with '\-,' only the channels listed in the file will be just copied to the output while any other channels are converted and written out.
If the shared memory segment with the key
.I \ outkey
does not exist, a shared memory segment with a size of
.I \ shmsize
\ (KB) will be created. When it already exists but has a size smaller than
.I \ shmsize
\ (KB), an error will occur.
The shared memory key is a 32-bit integer value.
.LP
ls8tel16_rawd is initiated in daemon mode.
.LP
When log file name
.I \ logfile
is specified, operation log is set here. When it is not specified, log information is sent to the standard output (however, it is sent to syslogd(8) when operation is made in the daemon mode). The log file is opened/closed in each write.
.LP
The channel file is a text file that hexadecimally lists channel numbers, one for each line. In each line, only the first item is read, while the subsequent items delimited by blanks or tabs are all ignored. Any lines starting with '#' are also ignored.
When receiving a hang-up signal, the ls8tel16_raw process rereads the channel file.
.LP
The format in the shared memory
.I inkey
can be either one sorted in order of time (Cf. order(1W)) or otherwise (Cf. recvt(1W)). The format in the shared memory
.I outkey
will be the same as that of
.I inkey.
.LP
When required to convert Hakusan win format data on disk, ls8tel16_win(1W) can be used.
.LP
When ls8tel16_raw is initiated without argument, brief usage is displayed.
.SH CAUTION
Application to any data other than those created by LS8TEL14 or LS8TEL16 will result in output data corruption.
